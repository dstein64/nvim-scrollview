2. Installation                            *scrollview-installation*

Use |packages| or one of the various package managers.

============================================================================
3. Usage                                   *scrollview-usage*

* |nvim-scrollview| works automatically, displaying interactive scrollbars and
  signs.
                                           *scrollview-mouse*

The scrollbars are draggable with a mouse. Signs can be clicked for navigation
or right-clicked for information. If |'mousemoveevent'| is set, scrollbars and
signs are highlighted when the mouse pointer hovers.

                                           *scrollview-commands*

                                           *:ScrollViewDisable*
:ScrollViewDisable     Disable the plugin.

:ScrollViewDisable {group1} ...
                       Disable the specified sign groups.

                                           *:ScrollViewEnable*
:ScrollViewEnable      Enable the plugin. This is only necessary if
                       nvim-scrollview has previously been disabled.

:ScrollViewEnable {group1} ...
                       Enable the specified sign groups.

                                           *:ScrollViewToggle*
:ScrollViewToggle      Toggle the plugin.

:ScrollViewToggle {group1} ...
                       Toggle the specified sign groups.

                                           *:ScrollViewRefresh*
:ScrollViewRefresh     Refresh the scrollbars and signs. This is relevant when
                       the state becomes out-of-sync, which can occur e.g., as
                       a result of some window arrangement actions (see
                       |scrollview-issues|).

:ScrollViewLegend[!] [{group1} ...]        *:ScrollViewLegend*
                       Show a legend for the scrollbar and signs. The optional
                       trailing arguments specify which sign groups are
                       considered (all groups when not specified). Without
                       [!], the legend will only contain items that are
                       currently visible. With [!], the legend will include
                       the scrollbar and all registered signs (even those from
                       disabled groups), regardless of their display status.

:[count]ScrollViewNext [{group1} ...]      *:ScrollViewNext*
                       Move the cursor to the [count]'th next line with a
                       sign. If the |'wrapscan'| option is set, the movement
                       wraps around the end of the buffer when necessary.
                       Otherwise, the movement stops at the last line with a
                       sign. The optional trailing arguments specify which
                       sign groups are considered (all groups when not
                       specified).

:[count]ScrollViewPrev [{group1} ...]      *:ScrollViewPrev*
                       Move the cursor to the [count]'th previous line with
                       a sign. If the |'wrapscan'| option is set, the movement
                       wraps around the beginning of the buffer when
                       necessary. Otherwise, the movement stops at the first
                       line with a sign. The optional trailing arguments
                       specify which sign groups are considered (all groups
                       when not specified).

:ScrollViewFirst [{group1} ...]            *:ScrollViewFirst*
                       Move the cursor to the first line with a sign. The
                       optional trailing arguments specify which sign groups
                       are considered (all groups when not specified).

:ScrollViewLast [{group1} ...]             *:ScrollViewLast*
                       Move the cursor to the last line with a sign. The
                       optional trailing arguments specify which sign groups
                       are considered (all groups when not specified).

                                           *scrollview-mappings*
The following |<Plug>| mappings are defined for convenience.

* `<Plug>(ScrollViewDisable)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewEnable)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewFirst)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewLast)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewLegend)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewLegend!)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewNext)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewPrev)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewRefresh)`
* `<Plug>(ScrollViewToggle)`

                                           *scrollview-enabled-global*
                                           *scrollview_enabled*
A global variable, `scrollview_enabled`, is set to |v:true| when the plugin is
enabled, and |v:false| otherwise. It can be accessed from Lua
(`vim.g.scrollview_enabled`) or Vimscript (`g:scrollview_enabled`). Do not
modify its value; it should be treated as read-only. Use |:ScrollViewEnable|,
|:ScrollViewDisable|, and |:ScrollViewToggle| to enable, disable, or toggle
the plugin.

                                           *scrollview-refreshing-global*
                                           *scrollview_refreshing*
A global variable, `scrollview_refreshing`, is set to |v:true| while scrollbars
are being refreshed, and |v:false| otherwise. It can be accessed from Lua
(`vim.g.scrollview_refreshing`) or Vimscript (`g:scrollview_refreshing`).

The plugin executes commands with `:normal!`, which are treated as if they are
typed. `scrollview_refreshing` may be useful for ignoring the corresponding keys
when using |vim.on_key()|.
 >
    vim.on_key(function(char)
        if vim.g.scrollview_refreshing then return end
        ...
    end)
<
                                           *scrollview-signs*
|nvim-scrollview| signs are similar to Neovim's built-in |signs|, but with
positioning logic matching that of the scrollbar. The plugin includes a set
of built-in sign groups (e.g., `search` signs show where in the document there
are search matches).

For configuring signs generally, and the built-in groups specifically, see
|scrollview-signs-configuration|. For extending sign functionality (e.g., in a
Neovim configuration file or with a plugin), see
|scrollview-signs-extensibility|.

When there are multiple signs displayed on the same row, they will be
positioned based on their priority. The higher the priority of a sign, which
is configurable, the closer it will be to the scrollbar. When the number of
signs exceeds the value specified by |scrollview_signs_max_per_row|, the lower
priority signs will be dropped.

Clicking on a sign will navigate to its associated line. If a sign is linked
to multiple lines, successive clicks will cycle through these lines.
Right-clicking a sign reveals additional information, including its sign group
and the corresponding lines, which can be selected for navigation. Identifying
the sign group can be helpful if you are unsure what a sign represents.

4. Configuration                           *scrollview-configuration*

Configuration Variables ~
                                           *scrollview_always_show*
scrollview_always_show |Boolean| specifying whether scrollbars and signs are
                       shown when all lines are visible. Defaults to |v:false|.

                                           *scrollview_base*
scrollview_base        |String| specifying where the scrollbar is anchored.
                       Possible values are `'left'` or `'right'` for corresponding
                       window edges, or `'buffer'`. Defaults to `'right'`.

                                           *scrollview_byte_limit*
scrollview_byte_limit  |Number| specifying the buffer size threshold (in
                       bytes) for entering restricted mode, to prevent slow
                       operation. Defaults to `1,000,000`. Use `-1` for no limit.

                                           *scrollview_character*
scrollview_character   |String| specifying a character to display on scrollbars.
                       Defaults to `''`. Scrollbar transparency (via
                       |scrollview_winblend|) is not possible when a scrollbar
                       character is used.

                                           *scrollview_column*
scrollview_column      |Number| specifying the scrollbar column (relative to
                       |scrollview_base|). Defaults to `1`. Must be an integer
                       greater than or equal to `1`.

scrollview_consider_border                 *scrollview_consider_border*
(experimental)         |Boolean| specifying whether floating window borders are
                       taken into account for positioning scrollbars and signs.
                       When set to |v:true|, borders are considered as part of
                       the window; scrollbars and signs can be positioned
                       where there are borders. When set to |v:false|, borders
                       are ignored. Defaults to |v:false|. The setting is only
                       applicable for floating windows that have borders, and
                       only relevant when |scrollview_floating_windows| is
                       turned on and |scrollview_base| is set to `'left'` or
                       `'right'`.

scrollview_current_only                    *scrollview_current_only*
                       |Boolean| specifying whether scrollbars and signs should
                       only be displayed in the current window. Defaults to
                       |v:false|.

scrollview_excluded_filetypes              *scrollview_excluded_filetypes*
                       |List| of |String|s specifying optional file types for
                       which scrollbars should not be displayed. Defaults to
                       `[]`.

scrollview_floating_windows                *scrollview_floating_windows*
(experimental)         |Boolean| specifying whether scrollbars and signs are
                       shown in floating windows. Defaults to |v:false|.

scrollview_hide_bar_for_insert             *scrollview_hide_bar_for_insert*
                       |Boolean| specifying whether the scrollbar is hidden in
                       the current window for insert mode. Defaults to |v:false|.
                       See |scrollview_signs_hidden_for_insert| for hiding signs.

scrollview_hide_on_cursor_intersect        *scrollview_hide_on_cursor_intersect*
                       |Boolean| specifying whether each scrollbar or sign
                       becomes hidden (not shown) when it would otherwise
                       intersect with the cursor. Defaults to |v:false|.
                       Requires `nvim>=0.7`.

scrollview_hide_on_float_intersect         *scrollview_hide_on_float_intersect*
                       |Boolean| specifying whether each scrollbar or sign
                       becomes hidden (not shown) when it would otherwise
                       intersect with a floating window. Defaults to |v:false|.

scrollview_hide_on_text_intersect          *scrollview_hide_on_text_intersect*
(experimental)         |Boolean| specifying whether each scrollbar or sign
                       becomes hidden (not shown) when it would otherwise
                       intersect with text (excluding virtual text). The
                       functionality may not work for lines where the last
                       character spans multiple cells (only the first cell of
                       the character would be considered for intersection).
                       For lines with concealed text, signs and the scrollbar
                       can become hidden when they don't intersect text. The
                       processing demands when enabling this option may result
                       in noticeable lag under certain environments,
                       especially on older hardware. Defaults to |v:false|.

scrollview_hover                           *scrollview_hover*
                       |Boolean| specifying whether the highlighting of
                       scrollbars and signs should change when hovering with
                       the mouse. Requires mouse support (see |'mouse'|) with
                       |'mousemoveevent'| set. Defaults to |v:true|.

scrollview_include_end_region              *scrollview_include_end_region*
                       |Boolean| specifying whether the region beyond the last
                       line is considered as containing ordinary lines for the
                       calculation of scrollbar height and positioning.
                       Defaults to |v:false|. See Issue #58 for details.

                                           *scrollview_line_limit*
scrollview_line_limit  |Number| specifying the buffer size threshold (in
                       lines) for entering restricted mode, to prevent slow
                       operation. Defaults to `20,000`. Use `-1` for no limit.

                                           *scrollview_mode*
scrollview_mode        |String| specifying what the scrollbar position and size
                       correspond to. See |scrollview-modes| for details on the
                       available modes. Defaults to `'auto'`.

scrollview_mouse_primary                   *scrollview_mouse_primary*
                       |String| specifying the button for primary mouse
                       operations (dragging scrollbars and clicking signs).
                       Possible values include `'left'`, `'middle'`, `'right'`,
                       `'x1'`, and `'x2'`. These can be prepended with `'c-'` or
                       `'m-'` for the control-key and alt-key variants (e.g.,
                       `'c-left'` for control-left). Set to `v:null` to disable
                       the functionality. Defaults to `'left'`. For `nvim<0.11`,
                       an existing mapping will not be clobbered, unless `'!'`
                       is added at the end (e.g., `'left!'`). For `nvim<0.11`,
                       the option is considered only when the plugin is loaded.

scrollview_mouse_secondary                 *scrollview_mouse_secondary*
                       |String| specifying the button for secondary mouse
                       operations (clicking signs for additional information).
                       See |scrollview_mouse_primary| for the possible values,
                       including how `'c-'`, `'m-'`, and `v:null` can be utilized,
                       as well as the behavior specific to `nvim<0.11`. Defaults
                       to `'right'`.

                                           *scrollview_on_startup*
scrollview_on_startup  |Boolean| specifying whether scrollbars are enabled on
                       startup. Defaults to |v:true|. Considered only when the
                       plugin is loaded.

                                           *scrollview_winblend*
scrollview_winblend    |Number| specifying the level of transparency for
                       scrollbars when a GUI is not running and 'termguicolors'
                       is not set. Defaults to `50`. Must be between `0` (opaque)
                       and `100` (transparent). This option is ignored for
                       scrollview windows whose highlight group has 'reverse'
                       or 'inverse' specified as a cterm attribute; see
                       |attr-list|. Such windows will have no transparency, as a
                       workaround for Neovim #24159. This option is ignored
                       for scrollview windows shown for floating windows; see
                       |scrollview_floating_windows|. Such windows will have no
                       transparency, as a workaround for Neovim #14624.

scrollview_winblend_gui                    *scrollview_winblend_gui*
(experimental)         |Number| specifying the level of transparency for
                       scrollbars when a GUI is running or 'termguicolors' is
                       set. Defaults to `0`. Must be between `0` (opaque) and `100`
                       (transparent). This option is ignored for scrollview
                       windows whose highlight group has 'reverse' or 'inverse'
                       specified as a gui attribute; see |attr-list|. Such
                       windows will have no transparency, as a workaround for
                       Neovim #24159. This option is ignored for scrollview
                       windows shown for floating windows; see
                       |scrollview_floating_windows|. Such windows will have no
                       transparency, as a workaround for Neovim #14624. This
                       option can interact with highlight settings
                       (|scrollview-color-customization|); careful adjustment of
                       the winblend setting and highlighting may be necessary
                       to achieve the desired result.

scrollview_zindex                          *scrollview_zindex*

Configuration Example ~
                                           *scrollview-configuration-example*
The variables can be customized in your |init.vim|, as shown in the following
example.
 >
    let g:scrollview_excluded_filetypes = ['nerdtree']
    let g:scrollview_current_only = v:true
    " Position the scrollbar at the 80th character of the buffer
    let g:scrollview_base = 'buffer'
    let g:scrollview_column = 80
    " Enable all sign groups (defaults to ['diagnostics', 'search'])
    let g:scrollview_signs_on_startup = ['all']

Lua Configuration ~
                                           *scrollview.setup()*
A Lua `setup()` function is provided for convenience, to set globally scoped
options (the 'scrollview_' prefix is omitted). For example:
 >
    require('scrollview').setup({
      excluded_filetypes = {'nerdtree'},
      current_only = true,
      -- Position the scrollbar at the 80th character of the buffer
      base = 'buffer',
      column = 80,
      signs_on_startup = {'all'}
    })

Alternatively, configuration variables can be set without calling `setup()`.
 >
    vim.g.scrollview_excluded_filetypes = {'nerdtree'},
    vim.g.scrollview_current_only = true,
    -- Position the scrollbar at the 80th character of the buffer
    vim.g.scrollview_base = 'buffer',
    vim.g.scrollview_column = 80,
    vim.g.scrollview_signs_on_startup = {'all'}

Scrollview Modes ~
                                           *scrollview-modes*
The following modes are available for the |scrollview_mode| configuration
setting (set as a |string|). Without (1) closed |folds|, (2) wrapped lines,
(3) diff filler, and (4) virtual text lines, all modes work the same way.

Mode       Description
----       -----------
`simple`     The scrollbar top position reflects the window's top line number
           relative to the document's line count. The scrollbar height
           reflects the size of the window relative to the document's line
           count. Dragging the scrollbars with the mouse may result in
           unresponsive scrolling when there are closed folds.

`virtual`    The scrollbar position and height are calculated similarly as for
           `simple` mode, but line numbers and the document line count are
           implicitly updated to virtual counterparts that account for closed
           folds. The scrollbar top position reflects the window's top virtual
           line number relative to the document's virtual line count. The
           scrollbar height reflects the size of the window relative to the
           document's virtual line count. This mode works slower than `simple`
           mode.

`proper`     The scrollbar position and height are calculated similarly as for
           `virtual` mode, but wrapped lines are considered in addition to
           folds. On `nvim>=0.10`, diff filler and virtual text lines are also
           considered. This mode works slower than `virtual` mode.

`auto`       Under `auto` mode, the effective mode is set to `proper` when there are
           relatively few buffer lines and luajit is available; `virtual` mode
           is used otherwise.

5. Sign Extensibility                      *scrollview-signs-extensibility*

The plugin was written so that it's possible to extend the sign functionality
in a Neovim configuration file or with a plugin.

                                           *scrollview-signs-version-global*
                                           *scrollview_signs_version*
A global variable, `scrollview_signs_version`, has an integer representing the
version of the sign exensibility functionality. This can be accessed from Lua
(`vim.g.scrollview_signs_version`) or Vimscript (`g:scrollview_signs_version`).

The following example shows how to implement sign functionality for showing
the cursor position. This is for the purpose of illustration; cursor signs are
already built in to `nvim-scrollview` (enable with `:ScrollViewEnable cursor`).
 >
    local scrollview = require('scrollview')

    local group = 'cursor'
    scrollview.register_sign_group(group)
    local registration = scrollview.register_sign_spec({
      current_only = true,
      group = group,
      highlight = 'SpellCap',
      show_in_folds = true,
    })
    local name = registration.name
    scrollview.set_sign_group_state(group, true)

    scrollview.set_sign_group_callback(group, function()
      for _, winid in ipairs(scrollview.get_sign_eligible_windows()) do

6. Keyword Signs                           *scrollview-signs-keywords*

The keyword sign group has built-in support for a set of keyword groups
(not to be confused with sign groups).

Group  Keywords
-----  --------
`fix`    FIX, FIXME
`hack`   HACK
`todo`   TODO
`warn`   WARN, WARNING
`xxx`    XXX

The signs for keywords can be customized. The settings described here are
considered only when the plugin is loaded (e.g., through an |init.vim| or
|init.lua| configuration file).

The built-in keyword signs can be customized by modifying their configuration
variables (see those starting with `'scrollview_keywords_'` under
|scrollview-signs-built-in-config|). For example, the following code changes the
symbols for the "fix" and "todo" keyword signs.

Vimscript: >
    let g:scrollview_keywords_fix_symbol = nr2char(0x1F527)
    let g:scrollview_keywords_todo_symbol = nr2char(0x2705)

Lua: >
    vim.g.scrollview_keywords_fix_symbol = vim.fn.nr2char(0x1F527)
    vim.g.scrollview_keywords_todo_symbol = vim.fn.nr2char(0x2705)
<
The built-in keyword signs can be disabled by modifying
|scrollview_keywords_built_ins|. For example, the following code disables some
keyword signs by enabling only a specfic subset.

Vimscript: >
    let g:scrollview_keywords_built_ins = ['fix', 'todo']

Lua: >
    vim.g.scrollview_keywords_built_ins = {'fix', 'todo'}
<
Additional groups of keyword signs can be added by creating a dictionary with
a specific form for its name, `g:scrollview_keywords_GROUP_spec` (with `GROUP`
replaced accordingly). It is comprised of the following items.

* `patterns`: a list of strings, each containing a Lua pattern that will be
  searched for
* `highlight`: an optional highlight group
* `priority`: an optional number indicating sign priority
* `symbol`: an optional string to use for the sign symbol

For example, with the following Vimscript code, |nvim-scrollview| will show
signs for lines that have the text `'NOTE'`.
>
    highlight ScrollViewKeywordsNote ctermfg=4 guibg=Blue
    let g:scrollview_keywords_note_spec = {
          \   'patterns': ['NOTE'],
          \   'highlight': 'ScrollViewKeywordsNote',
          \   'priority': 20,
          \   'symbol': 'N',
          \ }

7. Issues                                  *scrollview-issues*

Synchronization Issues ~
                                           *scrollview-synchronization-issues*
* Scrollbars can become out-of-sync after modifying window arrangement with
  |:wincmd|. |:ScrollViewRefresh|, or scrolling can be used to refresh the
  scrollbars.

* Scrollbars become out-of-sync after ":" fold commands when using a
  |scrollview-mode| that accounts for folds. Because there are no |autocmd-events|
  for folding, the plugin is unable to refresh the scrollbars.
  |:ScrollViewRefresh|, or scrolling can be used to refresh the scrollbars.

Error Message Issues ~
                                           *scrollview-error-message-issues*
* For `nvim<=0.6.1`, when attempting to close the last window in a tab with
  |:close| or `<ctrl-w>c`, with the scrollbar displayed, and at least one
  other tab, the following error is shown: >
    E5601: Cannot close window, only floating window would remain
<  Neovim Issue #11440 is the corresponding issue, opened November 23, 2019
  and closed February 11, 2022.
  - Workaround 1: Use |:quit|, |ZZ|, |ZQ|, or another command that quits the
    current window (as opposed to a window-closing command).
  - Workaround 2: Use |:only| or `<ctrl-w>o` on the last window of the tab,
    which has the side-effect of closing all floating windows (including
    scrollbars). A subsequent window-closing command works without error.
  - Workaround 3: Use |:tabclose|.
  - Workaround 4: Remap the problematic key sequence accordingly. >
    nnoremap <silent> <c-w>c
          \ <cmd>silent! ScrollViewDisable<cr>
          \<cmd>execute "normal! \<c-w>c"<cr>
          \<cmd>silent! ScrollViewEnable<cr>
<    This won't resolve the issue in all cases (e.g., when using |:close| or
    |:wincmd|). |<Plug>| mappings cannot be used, as they require recursive maps,
    and <c-w>c would infinitely recurse, as its usage on the right-hand-side
    is not at the beginning (see |recursive_mapping| for details).

* For `nvim<=0.6.1`, deleting a buffer with |:bdelete|, when it's the only visible
  buffer and there are multiple buffers on the buffer list, results in the
  following error (with duplicate lines, as shown): >
    E444: Cannot close last window
    E444: Cannot close last window
<  The buffer may not be deleted from the buffer list. Neovim Issue #13628 is
  the corresponding issue, opened December 28, 2020 and closed March 23, 2022.
  - Workaround 1: Use |:only| or `<ctrl-w>o`, which has the side-effect of closing
    all floating windows (including scrollbars). A subsequent |:bdelete| command
    works without error.
  - Workaround 2: Create a `Bdelete` command that avoids the issue. >
    command Bdelete
          \ silent! ScrollViewDisable
          \ | bdelete
          \ | silent! ScrollViewEnable

Other Issues ~
                                           *scrollview-other-issues*
* For `nvim<=0.7.0`, sessions cannot be properly restored by |:mksession| scripts
  created when the plugin is active (Issue #71). Neovim Issue #18432 is the
  corresponding issue, opened May 5, 2022.
  - Workaround: Create a `MkSession` command that avoids the problem. >
    command -bang -nargs=? MkSession
          \ silent! ScrollViewDisable
          \ | mksession<bang> <args>
          \ | silent! ScrollViewEnable

* Because scrollbars are floating windows, they are included in the window
  count returned by `winnr('$')`.
  - Workaround 1: Use a Vimscript function that omits external and floating
    windows in the count. >
    function! WindowCount()
      let l:result = 0
      for l:winnr in range(1, winnr('$'))
        let l:config = nvim_win_get_config(win_getid(l:winnr))
        if !get(l:config, 'external', 0)
              \ && get(l:config, 'relative', '') ==# ''
          let l:result += 1
        endif
      endfor
      return l:result
    endfunction
<  - Workaround 2: Use a Lua function that omits external and floating windows
    in the count. >
    local window_count = function()
      local result = 0
      for winnr = 1, vim.fn.winnr('$') do
        local config = vim.api.nvim_win_get_config(vim.fn.win_getid(winnr))
        local not_external = config.external == nil or not config.external
        local not_floating = config.relative == nil or config.relative == ''
        if not_external and not_floating then
          result = result + 1
        end
      end
      return result
    end
