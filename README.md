# nvim-scrollview

`nvim-scrollview` is a Neovim plugin that displays interactive vertical
scrollbars and signs. The plugin is customizable (see `:help
scrollview-configuration`).

## Features

* Handling for folds
* Scrollbars can be dragged with the mouse
* Signs (e.g., `diagnostics` and `search` enabled by default, and `marks` too
  for `nvim>=0.10`)

## Requirements

* `nvim>=0.6`
* Scrollbar mouse dragging requires mouse support (see `:help 'mouse'`)
* Signs require `nvim>=0.9`

## Installation

A package manager can be used to install `nvim-scrollview`.

## Usage

* `nvim-scrollview` works automatically, displaying interactive scrollbars.
* `:ScrollViewDisable` disables the plugin. When arguments are given,
  the specified sign groups are disabled.
* `:ScrollViewEnable` enables the plugin. This is only necessary if
  nvim-scrollview has previously been disabled. When arguments are given,
  the specified sign groups are enabled.
* `:ScrollViewToggle` toggles the plugin. When arguments are given, the
  specified sign groups are toggled.
* `:ScrollViewRefresh` refreshes the scrollbars and signs. This is relevant
  when the scrollbars or signs are out-of-sync, which can occur as a result of
  some window arrangement actions.
* `:ScrollViewNext`, `:ScrollViewPrev`, `:ScrollViewFirst`, and
  `:ScrollViewLast` move the cursor to lines with signs. Arguments can specify
  which sign groups are considered.
* The scrollbars can be dragged and signs can be clicked. This requires a
  corresponding mapping, which is automatically configured when
  `scrollview_auto_mouse` is set (see `:help scrollview-mouse-customization`).

## Signs

There is built-in support for various types of signs (referred to as "sign
groups"), listed below. The functionality is similar to the sign column, but
with the same positioning logic as the scrollbar.

* `conflicts`: git merge conflicts
* `cursor`: cursor position
* `diagnostics`: errors, warnings, info, and hints
* `folds`: closed folds
* `loclist`: items on the location list
* `marks`
* `quickfix`: items on the quickfix list
* `search`
* `spell`: spell check items when the `spell` option is enabled
* `textwidth`: line lengths exceeding the value of the textwidth option, when
  non-zero
* `trail`: trailing whitespace, when the `list` option is enabled and the
  `listchars` option includes "trail"

`search` and `diagnostics` groups are enabled by default (`marks` too for
`nvim>=0.10`). To modify which sign groups are enabled, set
`scrollview_signs_on_startup` accordingly in your Neovim configuation (see
`:help scrollview_signs_on_startup`), or use `:ScrollViewEnable {group1}
{group2} ...` to enable sign groups in the current Neovim session.

The plugin was written so that it's possible to extend the sign functionality
in a Neovim configuration file or with a plugin. See the documentation for
details.

The [contrib](lua/scrollview/contrib) directory contains sign group
implementations that are not built-in (e.g., `coc`, `gitsigns`), but may be
useful to some users. The code there does not receive the same level of support
as the main source code, and may be less stable. Use at your own risk. For
installation instructions and other documentation, see the source code files.

## Configuration

There are various settings that can be configured. Please see the documentation
for details. The code below only shows a few of the possible settings.

#### Vimscript Example

```vim
let g:scrollview_excluded_filetypes = ['nerdtree']
let g:scrollview_current_only = v:true
" Position the scrollbar at the 80th character of the buffer
let g:scrollview_base = 'buffer'
let g:scrollview_column = 80
" Enable all sign groups (defaults to ['diagnostics', 'search']).
" Set to the empty list to disable all sign groups.
let g:scrollview_signs_on_startup = ['all']
" Show diagnostic signs only for errors.
let g:scrollview_diagnostics_severities =
      \ [luaeval('vim.diagnostic.severity.ERROR')]
```

#### Lua Example

A Lua `setup()` function is provided for convenience, to set globally scoped
options (the 'scrollview_' prefix is omitted).

```lua
require('scrollview').setup({
  excluded_filetypes = {'nerdtree'},
  current_only = true,
  base = 'buffer',
  column = 80,
  signs_on_startup = {'all'},
  diagnostics_severities = {vim.diagnostic.severity.ERROR}
})
```

Alternatively, configuration variables can be set without calling `setup()`.

```lua
vim.g.scrollview_excluded_filetypes = {'nerdtree'},
vim.g.scrollview_current_only = true,
vim.g.scrollview_base = 'buffer',
vim.g.scrollview_column = 80,
vim.g.scrollview_signs_on_startup = {'all'},
vim.g.scrollview_diagnostics_severities = {vim.diagnostic.severity.ERROR}
```
## Documentation

Documentation can be accessed with:

```nvim
:help nvim-scrollview
```

The underlying markup is in [scrollview.txt](doc/scrollview.txt).

#### Issues

Documentation for issues, along with some workarounds, can be accessed with:

```nvim
:help scrollview-issues
```

Some of the known issues are regarding scrollbar synchronization, error messages, session
restoration, and scrollbar floating windows being included in the window count returned by
`winnr('$')`.
